<h1>You believe in the lies of the Devil!</h1>
<p><em><strong>2 Corinthians 11:14</strong> And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.</em></p>
<p>Do you agree that in this world, there is a physical death and evil? <strong>This physical world is a manifestation of God, who/what He is/wants</strong>. The very first commandment of God to humans was: <em>"You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die."</em> Because all humans are not perfect, all "fell short of the glory of God", we die. But through a sacrificial love, there is a certain everlasting life. The word "sacrifice" is crucial, mentioned 318x in Christian Standard Bible (CSB translation).</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The Old testament is all about God telling people how to live in accordance with love.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Matthew 22:40</strong> All the Law and the Prophets (spoken by Jesus about the Old testament) hang on these two commandments.' (to love God and to love your neighbour)</em></p>
<h2><strong>Who is God?</strong></h2>
<p>I am not a jehova witness. But still want to introduce you to God by telling you His name:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Exo 34:6-7</strong> Adonai passed before him and proclaimed: "YUD-HEH-VAV-HEH!!! Yud-Heh-Vav-Heh [Adonai] is God, merciful and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in grace and truth; 7 showing grace to the thousandth generation, forgiving offenses, crimes and sins; yet not exonerating the guilty, but causing the negative effects of the parents' offenses to be experienced by their children and grandchildren, and even by the third and fourth generations."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Think about this: <strong>Does God have a name and can any name be sufficient for God?</strong> Thus when asked about his name, he introduces the fundamental laws that take place, which you and I can daily experience because these are most precious to God.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In other words, if your father was a drunkard, it may affect you and possibly up to the fourth generation. But if you change your ways, up to the thousandth generation, people may benefit from you, because being slow to anger and showing grace and compassion is so much more powerful!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Genesis 1:27</strong> So <strong>God created humankind in his own image</strong>; in the image of God he created him: male and female he created them.</em></p>
<h2>What does God look like?</h2>
<p>This is the second commandment of the Old testament:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Exodus 20:4</strong> "You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.5 You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, 6 but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Deuteronomy 4:12</strong> You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness.12 Then the Lord spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice. 13 He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>15 You saw no form of any kind the day the Lord spoke to you at Horebout of the fire. Therefore watch yourselves very carefully, 16 so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an image of any shape, whether formed like a man or a woman, 17 or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air,....</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The time of Old testament was more a physical representation of God's righteousness, it's been like this here on earth for at least 4000 years (-4000 till 0). This means God was regularly physically <strong>blessing or punishing</strong> his own people according to what they deserved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is the covenant which God promised to Abraham that He will make with his descendants:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Deuteronomy 11:26</strong> See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse-the blessing if you obey the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you today; the curse if you disobey the commands of the Lord your God and turn from the way that I command you today by following other <strong>gods</strong>, which you have not known.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Deuteronomy 11:13</strong> So if you faithfully obey the commands I am giving you today-to love the Lord your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul- then I will send rain on your land in its season, both autumn and spring rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine and olive oil. I will provide grass in the fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Deuteronomy 11:16</strong> Be careful, or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods and bow down to them. Then the Lord's anger will burn against you, and he will shut up the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce, and you will soon perish from the good land the Lord is giving you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p>Nature, as we know it, it fluctuating between <strong>prospering</strong> sunshine and a <strong>hostile</strong> winter. In the same way, the Old testament represents the <strong>blessing and a curse</strong>. Through the law we know about the sin and punishment. There's countless of stories in the Old testament like this one, so it physically worked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Judges 3:7-9</strong> The Israelites did what was evil in the Lord's sight; they forgot the Lord their God and worshiped the Baals and the Asherahs. The Lord's anger burned against Israel, and he sold them to King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram-naharaim, and the Israelites served him eight years.</em><em> The Israelites cried out to the Lord. So the Lord raised up Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's youngest brother, as a deliverer to save the Israelites.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p>But because such covenant is not sufficient, it's been here only for a season, one day, God instituted a new New Covenant in which nobody dies through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong><span style="display: inline;">Ezekiel 18:31</span></strong> Cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. <strong>For why should you die</strong>, O house of Israel?</em></p>
<h2>Why Jesus Christ?</h2>
<p>To answer this, I will take you back to Egypt, to the fullfilment of God's promise He gave to Abraham:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Exodus 6:2</strong></em> Then God spoke to Moses, telling him, "I am the Lord. 3 I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but I was not known to them by my name 'the Lord.' 4 I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land they lived in as aliens.5 Furthermore, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are forcing to work as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6 "Therefore tell the Israelites: I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from the forced labor of the Egyptians and rescue you from slavery to them. I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and great acts of judgment. 7 I will take you as my people, and I will be your God. You will know that I am the Lord your God, who brought you out from the forced labor of the Egyptians. 8 I will bring you to the land that I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I will give it to you as a possession. I am the Lord."</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>"I was reading about Moses how he led people from Egypt about the plagues and I was completely mindblown as i imagined how terribly was Egypt being destroyed. So that we know the God we worship is THE God, that there is no other God capable of anything like that.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Literally two old men came to town, alone and unarmed, and as a consequence the entire Egypt suffered as if someone sent a heavy modern army to blow things up, casualties, everything green and some structures badly destroyed. Insane."</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Egypt was trying to fight against God. But because God said that His people are free, there is nothing and nobody that can ever keep them in slavery.</strong> Interestingly, Egypt was also fighting back using demonic powers which allowed them to perform miracles similar to those Moses did. But they themselves could not withstand the "finger of God".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I highly recoment reading the book of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Exodus&amp;qs_version=ESV" target="_blank">Exodus</a> as it is one that is very quick to read through. Since knowing the story is essential to fully understand what the <strong>sacrifice of the lamb</strong> means, I will include <strong>the very last and most terrible plague God inflicted on Egypt for their disobedience to God's Word.</strong></p>
<h2><em>The Passover is Instituted</em></h2>
<p><em><strong>Exodus 12</strong> The Lord told Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, 2 "This month will mark the beginning of months for you. It will be the first month of the year for you. 3 Tell the entire congregation of Israel, 'On the tenth of this month they're each to take a lamb for themselves, according to their ancestors' households, one lamb for each household. 4 If a household is too small for a lamb, then it and its closest neighbor are to obtain one based on the number of individuals, dividing the lamb, based on what each person can eat. 5 Your lamb is to be a year old male without blemish. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats. 6 It is to remain under your care until the fourteenth day of this month, and then the entire assembly of the congregation of Israel is to slaughter it at twilight. 7 They're to take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses where they eat the lamb.[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+12&amp;version=ISV#fen-ISV-1824b">b</a>]8 That very night they're to eat the meat, roasted over the fire, with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 9 Don't eat any of it raw or boiled in water. Instead, roast it over the fire, with its head, legs, and internal organs. 10 Don't leave any of it until morning, and whatever does remain of it until morning you are to burn in the fire.</em></p>
<p><em>11 "'This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. You are to eat it hurriedly-it's the Lord's Passover. 12 I'll pass through the land of Egypt that night and strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both people and animals. I'll execute judgments on all the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord. 13 The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are. I'll see the blood and pass over you. There will be no plague to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.</em></p>
<p><em>14 "'This day is to be a memorial for you, and you are to celebrate it as a festival to the Lord. You are to celebrate it as a perpetual ordinance from generation to generation. ...</em></p>
<p><em>21 Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and told them, "Choose sheep for your families, and slaughter the Passover lamb. 22 Take a bundle of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and apply some of the blood in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts. None of you is to go out of the doorway of his house until morning, 23 because the Lord will pass through to strike down the Egyptians, and when he sees the blood on the lintel and the two doorposts, the Lord will pass over the doorway, and won't allow the destroyer to enter your houses to strike you down. 24 You are to observe this event as a perpetual ordinance for you and your children forever. 25 When you enter the land that the Lord will give you, just as he promised, you are to observe this ritual. 26 And when your children say to you, 'What does this ritual mean?' 27 you are to say, 'It is the Passover sacrifice to the Lord, who passed over the houses of the Israelis in Egypt when he struck down the Egyptians but spared our houses.'" Then the people bowed down and worshipped. 28 The Israelis did this. Moses and Aaron did just what the Lord had commanded.</em></p>
<h2><em>The Death of the Firstborn in Egypt</em></h2>
<p><em>29 And so at midnight the Lord struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the livestock. 30 Pharaoh got up during the night, he, all his officials, and all the Egyptians, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, because there was not a house without someone dead in it. 31 Then he summoned Moses and Aaron during the night and told them: "Get up, go out from among my people, both you and the Israelis! Go, serve the Lord as you have said. 32 Take both your sheep and your cattle, just as you demanded and go! And bless me too!"</em></p>
<p><em>33 The Egyptian officials urged the people to send them out of the land quickly, because they were saying, "We'll all be dead!" 34 So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls wrapped up in their cloaks on their shoulders. 35 Meanwhile, the Israelis had done as Moses said; they had asked the Egyptians for objects of silver and objects of gold, and for clothes. 36 The Lord had given the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, so that they gave them what they requested. As a result, they plundered the Egyptians.</em></p>
<h2>Disobedience to God's word means death</h2>
<p>We see death all around. But God teaches us that there is a way how to be saved: "Through love."</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Ecclesiastes 3:11</strong> It is beautiful how God has done everything at the right time. He has put a sense of eternity in people's minds. Yet, mortals still can't grasp what God is doing from the beginning to the end of time.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p>The sacrifice of Jesus is fullfilment of the Old testament's law. He is the lamb, that's been slain for our slavery to sin:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>John 8:34</strong> Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>And because of the name of God "<em>yet not exonerating the guilty</em>", there is no other way back to the presense of the Father, except through a sacrifice. They used to do animal sacrifices but those were only a shadow of the true love that was to come.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>John 14:6</strong> Jesus told him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus' sacrifice was an act of God's love.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>John 3:16</strong> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Mark 10:45</strong> It's the same way with the Son of Man. He didn't come so that others could serve him. He came to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many people."</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Because sacrifice has always been here and still is</em>, we must exercise this new law of sacrifice in Christ in order to put in practice the sacrifice of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>1 John 3:16</strong> This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Romans 6:8</strong> Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.<br /></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Mark 8:34-35</strong> Then Jesus called the crowd, along with his disciples, and said to them, "If anyone wants to become my follower, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and for the gospel will save it.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>By losing our lives we generally mean to show love for Christ's sake since God wants us to show acts of kindness (because of care), rather then just keeping some dead commandments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is only a season of this world that is obsolete. One day, God will create everything anew and no sacrifices will be necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Revelation 21:</em>3</strong> And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Look! God's dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. 'He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death' or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away." He who was seated on the throne said, "I am making everything new!" Then he said, "Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true."</p>

<h2><strong>Christians can eat meat</strong></h2>
<p>Since death and sacrifices are an integral part of this sinful and temporary world, God himself gave us animals for food.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Genesis 9:3</strong> You may eat any moving thing that lives. As I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jesus ate the passover lamb:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Luke 22:8</strong> Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the <strong>Passover for us to eat.</strong>"</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Jesus ate fish after His resurrection:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Luke 24:33-43</strong> While they were saying these things, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you." 37 But they were startled and terrified, thinking they saw a ghost. 38 Then he said to them, "Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? 39 Look at my hands and my feet; it's me! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones like you see I have." 40 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. 41 And while they still could not believe it (because of their joy) and were amazed, he said to them, "Do you have anything here to eat?" 42 <strong>So they gave him a piece of broiled fish, 43 and he took it and ate it in front of them.</strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p>This is why you do not accept Jesus and <strong>all</strong> of his teaching:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>John 1:10</strong> He was in the world, and the world was created by him, but the world did not recognize him.</em></p>
