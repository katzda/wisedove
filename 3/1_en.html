<h1>(Not)Eating meat from Biblical perspective</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
	<b>EATING MEAT</b><br />
	<b>Genesis 9:3</b> 			You may eat any moving thing that lives. As I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.<br />
	<b>Exodus 12:8</b> 			They are to eat the meat that night; they should eat it, roasted over the fire along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.<br />
	<b>Leviticus 7:15</b> 			The meat of his thanksgiving sacrifice of fellowship must be eaten on the day he offers it; he may not leave any of it until morning.<br />
	<b>Deuteronomy 12:15</b> 		[ Slaughtering Animals to Eat ] “But whenever you want, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your city gates, according to the blessing the Lord your God has given you. Those who are clean or unclean may eat it, as they would a gazelle or deer,<br />
	<b>Mark 7:15</b> 				Nothing that goes into a person from outside can defile him but the things that come out of a person are what defile him.”<br />
	<b>1 Corinthians 10:25</b> 	Eat everything that is sold in the meat market<br />
<br />
	ANIMAL SACRIFICES [OLD TESTAMENT PRIESTS] ARE REPLACED WITH A NEW COVENANT THROUGH JESUS<br />
	<b>Numbers 8:12</b> 			Next the Levites are to lay their hands on the heads of the bulls. Sacrifice one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the Lord, to make atonement for the Levites.<br />
	<b>Hebrews 7:24,27</b> 		But because [Jesus] remains [lives] forever, he holds his priesthood permanently. [Jesus] doesn’t need to offer sacrifices every day, as high priests do—first for their own sins, then for those of the people. He did this once for all time when he offered himself.<br />
	<b>2 Kings 17:35-36</b>		The Lord made a covenant with Jacob’s descendants and commanded them, “Do not fear other gods; do not bow in worship to them; do not serve them; do not sacrifice to them. Instead fear the Lord, who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm. You are to bow down to him, and you are to sacrifice to him.<br />
	<b>1 Chronicles 15:26</b> 		Because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord, with God’s help, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.<br />
	<b>2 Chronicles 7:1</b> 		[ The Dedication Ceremonies ] When Solomon finished praying, fire descended from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the temple.<br />
	<b>Ezra 3:1-2</b> 				(Sacrifice Restored) When the seventh month arrived, and the Israelites were in their towns, the people gathered as one in Jerusalem. Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers the priests along with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his brothers began to build the altar of Israel’s God in order to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God.<br />
<br />
	SIN MEANS DEATH, NOBODY COULD STAND A FIGHT AGAINST GOD'S PEOPLE UNLESS THEY'VE SINNED AS WELL<br />
	<b>Joshua 6:21</b> 			They completely destroyed everything in the city with the sword—every man and woman, both young and old, and every ox, sheep, and donkey.<br />
	<b>Judges 6:1</b> 				The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. So the Lord handed them over to Midian seven years, and they oppressed Israel.<br />
	<b>1 Kings 11:11</b> 			Then the Lord said to Solomon, “Since you have done this[a] and did not keep my covenant and my statutes, which I commanded you, I will tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant.<br />
<br />
	BLOOD WAS NOT ALLOWED TO BE EATEN<br />
	<b>1 Samuel 14:33</b> 			Some reported to Saul: “Look, the troops are sinning against the Lord by eating meat with the blood still in it.”<br />
<br />
	SATAN AND DEMONIC PRACTICES<br />
	<b>Deuteronomy 18:10-11</b> 	No one among you is to sacrifice his son or daughter in the fire, practice divination, tell fortunes, interpret omens, practice sorcery, 11 cast spells, consult a medium or a spiritist, or inquire of the dead.<br />
	<b>Job 6-12</b> 				One day the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came with them. The Lord asked Satan, “Where have you come from?” “From roaming through the earth,” Satan answered him, “and walking around on it.” Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? No one else on earth is like him, a man of perfect integrity, who fears God and turns away from evil.” Satan answered the Lord, “Does Job fear God for nothing? 10 Haven’t you placed a hedge around him, his household, and everything he owns? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. 11 But stretch out your hand and strike everything he owns, and he will surely curse you to your face.” “Very well,” the Lord told Satan, “everything he owns is in your power. However, do not lay a hand on Job himself.” So Satan left the Lord’s presence.<br />
	Even Satan tries to make himself look like an angel of light.<br />
	<b>2 Corinthians 11:14</b>	And it is no wonder. Even Satan tries to make himself look like an angel of light.<br />
	<b>Galatians 1:8-10</b>  		But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, a curse be on him! As we have said before, I now say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, a curse be on him! For am I now trying to persuade people,[b] or God? Or am I striving to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.<br />
