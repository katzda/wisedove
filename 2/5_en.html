<h1>Christain Love</h1>
<p>Why is God the essential foundation for us to be able to love and how does this love give us freedom in Christ?</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Guard your heart</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Proverbs 4:23</strong> Guard your heart above all else, for it is the source of life.</em></p>

<p>Christian love includes an act which comes from a decision. The decision comes from a pure heart. <strong>Love is not just the good deed but must be based on pure heart</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>How to have a pure heart</strong></p>
<p>Good deeds can also be done without a pure heart, but then it does not come from our personality but from a mere decision. Once I had a prejudice against someone and I said to myself: The man does not even look at me and he does not greet me, although I often do. That's why I too do not have to be friendly to him. It was within a Christian Assembly. Then one person prayed a very personal prayer based on psalm 23. The prayer could take about 5 minutes because she quoted each sentence in a very personal way. Then God cleansed my heart and I realized how in my heart I had formed a barrier of "anti-love". Now I was willing to accept the person as he is and make an active decision to go to him and be friendly.</p>

<p>We know we have a pure heart by being able to kindly and peacefully smile and bring peace to someone. If we see that we are not capable of this, we should let go of our ego and learn to physically go and say sorry, thanks and undo what we can undo and then pray to God in bold faith that we are forgiven (for we have done everything that we could) and God counts such a deed as an act of faith that leads to forgivness through Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The fact that we are forgiven we know by the Holy Spirit, who gives us peace. The Holy Spirit is given to every Christian; if you do not know what I'm talking about, read the New Testament, the Gospel, and the acts. The Holy Spirit is given to anyone who believes in order to become a new person, which is symbolically confessed by immersion in water.</p>

<p>But if we do not have a clean heart, it often paralyzes us, so we can not do good deeds as we hold on to the "anti-love" in our hearts. It is important, therefore, to guard our own hearts, in order to be able to accept discomfort or bear any difficulties. By overcoming the difficulties, we can then learn to understand God's love more practically, so it is good to come out of our comfort zone and try to build the ability to express love.</p>

<p><strong>Example of guarding your heart:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes another brother wrote me a message in which there was something I did not like. I immediately felt a mild anger in my head or heart. But I can not be angry at anyone because of who they are. Physically, I did not do anything, I actually answered quite normally but I could not get rid of the feeling of anger and the unpleasant feeling of sin in my heart. I was just outside the cinema on the street. Did not matter where I was, as God is everywhere with me, I began to pray for forgiveness because I knew in my heart that it needed to be cleansed. The joy and happiness then returned to my heart, that I have a God, who is addressing even the smallest problems!</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Jeremiah 17:9</strong> The heart is deceitful above all things and it is extremely sick; Who can understand it fully and know its secret motives?</em></p>

<p><strong>Beware when you can't be kind, smile or respond nicely, pray for forgiveness and liberation from sin or anything hindering God's grace from being revealed in You.</strong> Love is the foundation of our salvation. We are saved from God's love and because we show love instead of judgements.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Matthew 6:14-15</strong> "For if you forgive others their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you as well. 15 But if you don't forgive others, your Father will not forgive your offenses.</em></p>

<p><strong>Delicate discernment</strong></p>
<p>Say I'd grasp a tomato from the fridge for myself and it came to my mind to ask myself if God is ok with it. If I'm not feeling convicted then probably it's fine. But if I don't feel peace about it, will I thank God or someone for it? <strong>Well at least I did think about the relationship and I was prepared to say thank you and I at least thanked God before I acted, I did not just bluntly go by my feelings because I want it. This example shows good communication. In the same way, prayer is important as a means of communicating our imperfections with God the father. A lot of times I need to start praying only because it just came to me, the realization that I feel</strong> <strong>hardhearted.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Standing firmly on the foundations of love / rock</strong></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Isaiah 1:17</strong> Learn to do what is good.</em></p>

<p>Christian love does not enforce any meaningless rituals. Love only manifests itself by good deeds of pure heart. So how should we train showing love? One way that makes sense to me is to make a list of declarations like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I am the child of God, the prince(ss) of God's kingdom.</li>
	<li>I am generous, gentle, confident with a good posture and bold faith.</li>
	<li>I can smile because I do not care about anything in the world, I just hold on to the liberation in Jesus Christ from all problems and difficulties, from the negative circumstances, people, my own past, present or future.</li>
	<li>(I don't mean I don't care, I mean I'm free of it)</li>
	<li>I'm hilarious, open minded, I share funny stories with everyone around me.</li>
	<li>I can organize, plan and be decisive in difficult situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vision does not have to be something you are right away strong enough to do, it's <strong>standing up in faith, not in our own strength!</strong> So that God can be revealed in our weaknesses as we overcome this world.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>1 John 5:4</strong></em> because everyone who has been born of God conquers the world. This is the victory that has conquered the world: our faith.</p>

You can keep changing your vision daily based on things you need to work on. Good is also a morning bible reading and prayers, asking God to show me another thing to work on.</p>

<p>I also often think of the prophet Daniel who prayed three times a day. He stood at the window and started praising God raising his hands, despite his feelings whether he felt like it or whether it was safe for him to do it. That's how I imagine a stable and unshakable faith/love/acts.
<b>The third point talks about the basis on which to stand (or "build our house"). </b>If our happiness depends on our feelings, marriage, children, dreams of the future, we will never be happy and capable of the true love that is unconditional. Thanks to God's love, we are able to live and move forward independently of those negative things.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jesus said:<br/>
<em><strong>Matthew 7:24</strong> So then, anyone who hears these words of mine and obeys them is like a wise man who built his house on rock. The rain poured down, the rivers overflowed, and the wind blew hard against that house. But it did not fall, because it was built on rock. "But anyone who hears these words of mine and does not obey them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain poured down, the rivers overflowed, the wind blew hard against that house, and it fell. And what a terrible fall that was!"</em></p>

<p><b>Practice your vision</b><br>
It is quite important to try acting the vision as if in a theathe so that the words do not remain just empty but they get into your flesh through the step of faith so that faith is based on the supernatural liberating power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>1 Corinthians 2:4-5</strong> My speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of wisdom but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power, so that your faith might not be based on human wisdom but on God’s power.</em></p>

<p>As Moses had to physically strike his staff in the sea so that God could divide it, so we must make a step of faith and learn to do good so that God can internally turn us into a new person. Moses first cried out to God but God said: Why are you crying out for help? Go and strike your stick in the sea so you can all walk through it on dry ground.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Mark 11:24 24</strong> Therefore, I say unto you, Believe that all that ye ask in prayer is given unto you, and ye shall have it.</em></p>
<p>Expect to become strong person who will be able to withstand difficult situations, and nothing will be able to lead you astray. Build this foundation of love. Every day, choose God's grace and faithfulness. By doing this, you will become the temple of God. Solomon had been builting the temple of God for many years. After completion, the temple was sanctified and filled with God's glory so God will be acting very powerfully in our lives.</p>

<h2><strong>Freedom in Christ</strong></h2>
<p>For Jesus' death on the cross means a liberation from negative relationships, negative thoughts, miserable past, unpleasant present time, fear of the future, all scars and all problems hindering us from our growth. God has the power to restore You and fight for you, esp. when you also go and start fighting against the devil with powerful declarations of your vision.</p>

<p>Therefore raise your hand right now, grasp your worries and throw them off! Get up, focus on the positive things! Repent of negativity! Proclaim your vision, say God is good and even things you don't see how it could ever be done, declare them in faith! God can open the doors that you knew not of.</p>

<p>God is the creator of even the smallest subatomic particles. There is no problem in the world too small for God to know about it and to be not interested to free us from it.</p>

<p><strong>We are the citizens of the heavenly kingdom, which is a government that is looking after us when we overcome this world with unconditional love in Jesus Christ.</strong> So let's declare the kingdom of God in our lives on earth to be as it is in heaven - to fight against all illnesses, worries, depressions and everything. Jesus gives us the ability to rejoice every day!</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>James 1:2</strong> Consider it a great joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you experience various trials because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing.</em><br/>
<em><strong>Matthew 5:45</strong> For he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good... Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</em>

<p><strong>That is perfection when we overcome the world the way Jesus did, when we do not judge but instead proclaim love into peoples lives!</strong> This way we are commanded to be perfect just as our heavenly Father is perfect. Then if we are occasionally imperfect, it does not matter because the verse doesn't speak about the ultimate perfection (the final transformation of our bodies) but the attitude of always striving for perfection. We are capable of doing some things perfectly. Don't say: "we are never gonna be perfect" because Bible doesn't command us what is impossible. Instead, we should encourage each other to be better/perfect next time, forgetting any past shortcomings.</p>

<h2><strong>Spiritual growth</strong></h2>
<p>I used to go to a traditional church where I did not see multitudes of young people eager to serve in every possible way and I did not grow in faith for many years. I felt like doing the same things over and over without really progressing or going anywhere. I do feel much more encouraged now; we were a very small "family" church; quite rarely, I got to come out of my comfort zone. Instead, I used to follow my own lazy feelings, passivity when receiving the word of the sermon, when listening to worships, feeling "very clever" and "holy". In fact, we are most clever when we ask difficult questions. Most holy when we serve God in discomfort in faith. We are victorious and strong, NOT when we realize how pleasantly strong we feel BUT when we overcome weaknesses and pursue freedom to do anything in Jesus.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong><span style="display: inline;">Philippians 4:13</span></strong> I can do all things in Christ who strengthens me.</em></p>

<p><strong>Satan wants us to be comfortable, lazy and to not pray.</strong> Satan also wants us to think we should find our "home" church where we can feel comfortable, passively receive, complain if you do not get enough attention and/or settle in complacency (rest on your laurels).</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong><span style="display: inline;">Matthew 8:20</span></strong> Jesus told him, "Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."</em></p>

<p>So we too have no home on Earth, we should not be encouraged to meet only where we feel at home. <strong>Church should be called a practice field where we should learn how to practise being the light of the world and showing selfless love.</strong> Bible describes <a href="http://katzda.blog.cz/1803/winning-the-war" target="_self">Christians as warriors</a> in a war! We are <strong>not</strong> most smart when we feel we understand things, but when we face unanswered hard questions. We grow most when we serve selflessly (as the light of the world), not when others serve us spiritually. We are most powerful when we overcome our weaknesses and follow freedom in Christ.</p>

<p><strong>We are the light of the world, not black holes!</strong></p>
<p>Do not pray only like this: "God come and fill me!" because you have already been filled with the Holy Spirit. <strong>Jesus came into this world not to be served but to serve.</strong> The same way as we congregate, learn to come not in the hope to be served but to serve and expect nothing back. <strong>Be free of this world.</strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Luke 6:31</strong> Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you.</em>

<p>God knows about your need to be filled with the Holy Spirit in order for Him to be glorified. But He first needs us to be his available hands and legs.</p>

<p>Consider this, If you go to gym and pray the words: "Jesus help me pull myself up this bar one more time! And one more time!" Some people might say Jesus is to be with us in every situation. Ok, but how about this prayer: "Jesus help me become a blessing to anyone I will meet in the gym so I can be the light for you." The second prayer is outwardly focused, the first one aims inwards. Simple as that, they're aiming at the opposite directions.</p>
<p>As Christians, we need to change our perspective, the way we think. Aim outwards, surrender your desires to God which He knows you have. It forces us to come out of our comfort zone and to rely on only on God and so it is so much more powerful way of praying! Then you'll get experience and you will actually be a soldier of Christ who does work for God.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Another story (Matt 14): After John the baptist was beheaded, Jesus, because he was fully human, He must have experienced grief and we read that he wanted to go to a private place. As he went across a lake (or a sea), multitudes of people had awaited him already there. And moved with compassion He healed their sick. So in my opinion, it is nothing bad to experience a desire to be served, pray for yourself or "chill out" but if you can help, ideally other people should take priority. <strong>Whoever can show the greatest love is the greatest in heaven</strong>.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong><span style="display: inline;">Mark 9:35</span></strong> Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all</em></p>


<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>So Christian love is a proactive act of choosing joy no matter what, it makes one stand up and fight for the good, as opposed to follow some dead rules (how to deal with relationships,..) or commands, we just look at Jesus and do what we know is right, as best as we can. If you have doubts, just pray, think carefuly what is best, do it and don't worry about it.</p>
