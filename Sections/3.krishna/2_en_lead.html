<p><em><strong>2 Corinthians 11:14</strong> And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.</em></p>
<p>Do you agree that in this world, there is a physical death and evil? <strong>This physical world is a manifestation of God, who/what He is/wants</strong>. The very first commandment of God to humans was: <em>"You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die."</em> Because all humans are not perfect, all "fell short of the glory of God", we die. But through a sacrificial love, there is a certain everlasting life. <strong>The word "sacrifice" is crucial, mentioned 318x in Christian Standard Bible (CSB translation)</strong>.</p>
