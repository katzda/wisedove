<h1>Christain Love</h1>
<p>Why is God the essential foundation for us to be able to love and how does this love give us freedom in Christ?</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Guard your heart</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Proverbs 4:23</strong> Guard your heart above all else, for it is the source of life.</em></p>

<p>Christian love includes an act which comes from a decision. The decision comes from a pure heart. <strong>Love is not just the good deed but must be based on pure heart</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>How to have a pure heart</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Proverbs 4:23</strong> Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.</em></p>
 
<p>But if we do not have a clean heart, it often paralyzes us, so we can not do good deeds as we hold on to the "anti-love" in our hearts. It is important, therefore, to guard our own hearts, in order to be able to accept discomfort or bear any difficulties. By overcoming the difficulties, we can then learn to understand God's love more practically, so it is good to come out of our comfort zone and try to build the ability to express love.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Jeremiah 17:9</strong> The heart is deceitful above all things and it is extremely sick; Who can understand it fully and know its secret motives?</em></p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes another brother wrote me a message in which there was something I did not like. I immediately felt a mild anger in my head or heart. But I can not be angry at anyone because of who they are. Physically, I did not do anything, I actually answered quite normally but I could not get rid of the feeling of anger and the unpleasant feeling of sin in my heart. I was just outside the cinema on the street. Did not matter where I was, as God is everywhere with me, I began to pray for forgiveness because I knew in my heart that it needed to be cleansed. The joy and happiness then returned to my heart, that I have a God, who is addressing even the smallest problems!</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Matthew 6:14-15</strong> "For if you forgive others their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you as well. 15 But if you don't forgive others, your Father will not forgive your offenses.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Standing firmly on the foundations of love / rock</strong></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Isaiah 1:17</strong> Learn to do what is good.</em></p>

<p>Christian love does not enforce any meaningless rituals. Love only manifests itself by good deeds of pure heart. So how should we train showing love? One way that makes sense to me is to make a list of declarations like this: <br/>
(in agreement with Jesus' advice: <i><b>Mark 11:24 (ESV)</b> Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</i>)</p>

<ul>
	<li>I am the child of God, the prince(ss) of God's kingdom.</li>
	<li>I am generous, gentle, confident with a good posture and bold faith.</li>
	<li>I can smile because I do not care about anything in the world, I just hold on to the liberation in Jesus Christ from all problems and difficulties, from the negative circumstances, people, my own past, present or future.</li>
	<li>(I don't mean I don't care, I mean I'm free of it)</li>
	<li>I'm hilarious, open minded, I share funny stories with everyone around me.</li>
	<li>I can organize, plan and be decisive in difficult situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>These words are ment to address issues which you feel are most problematic, this it the <strong>standing up in faith and not in our own strength</strong>. God be revealed in our weaknesses as we overcome the world!</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i><strong>1 John 5:4</strong> because everyone who has been born of God conquers the world. This is the victory that has conquered the world: our faith.</i></p>

<p>You can keep changing your vision daily based on things you need to work on. Good is also a morning bible reading and prayers, asking God to show me another thing to work on.</p>

<p>I also often think of the prophet Daniel who prayed three times a day. He stood at the window and started praising God raising his hands, despite his feelings whether he felt like it or whether it was safe for him to do it. That's how I imagine a stable and unshakable faith/love/acts.
<b>The third point</b> (of the declarations above) <b>talks about the basis on which to stand (or "build our house"). </b>If our happiness depends on our feelings, marriage, children, dreams of the future, we will never be happy and capable of the true love that is unconditional. Thanks to God's love, we are able to live and move forward independently of those negative things.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jesus said:<br/>
<em><strong>Matthew 7:24</strong> So then, anyone who hears these words of mine and obeys them is like a wise man who built his house on rock. The rain poured down, the rivers overflowed, and the wind blew hard against that house. But it did not fall, because it was built on rock. "But anyone who hears these words of mine and does not obey them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain poured down, the rivers overflowed, the wind blew hard against that house, and it fell. And what a terrible fall that was!"</em></p>

<p><b>Practice your vision</b><br>

<p>It is also good trying to act out the vision as if in a theater so that the words do not remain just empty but they get into your flesh through these steps of faith. Then God will start liberating you of your addictions and bad habbits through the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>1 Corinthians 2:4-5</strong> My speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of wisdom but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power, so that your faith might not be based on human wisdom but on God’s power.</em></p>

<p>As Moses had to <b>physically</b> strike his staff in the sea so that God could divide it, so we must make a step of faith and learn to <b>do</b> good and then God will do the supernatural change and turn us into a new person. 

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Exodus 14:15</strong> The LORD said to Moses, “Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward. Lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the people of Israel may go through the sea on dry ground.</em></p>

<p>Expect to become a strong person who will be able to withstand difficult situations, and nothing will be able to lead you astray. Build this foundation of love. Every day, choose God's grace and faithfulness. By doing this, you will become the temple of God. Solomon had been builting the temple of God for many years. After completion, the temple was sanctified and filled with God's glory so God will be acting very powerfully in our lives.</p>

<h2><strong>Freedom in Christ</strong></h2>
<p>For Jesus' death on the cross means liberation from negative relationships, negative thoughts, miserable past, unpleasant present time, fear of the future, all scars and all problems hindering us from our growth. God has the power to restore You and fight for you, esp. when you also go and start fighting against the devil with powerful declarations of your vision.</p>

<p>Therefore raise your hand right now, grasp your worries and throw them off! Get up, focus on the positive things! Repent of negativity! Proclaim your vision, say God is good and even things you don't see how it could ever be done, declare them in faith! God can open the doors that you knew not of.</p>

<p>God is the creator of even the smallest subatomic particles. There are no problems in the world too small for God to be aware of them and too small to be interested in setting us free from them.</p>

<p><strong>We are the citizens of the heavenly kingdom, which is a government that is looking after us when we overcome this world with unconditional love in Jesus Christ.</strong> So let's declare the kingdom of God in our lives on earth to be as it is in heaven - to fight against all illnesses, worries, depressions and everything. Jesus gives us the ability to rejoice every day!</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>James 1:2</strong> Consider it a great joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you experience various trials because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing.</em><br/>
<em><strong>Matthew 5:45</strong> For he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good... Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</em>

<p><strong>That is perfection when we overcome the world the way Jesus did, when we do not judge but instead proclaim love into peoples lives!</strong> This way we are commanded to be perfect just as our heavenly Father is perfect. Then if we are occasionally imperfect then we have our saviour Jesus Christ who forgives us. Don't say: "we are never gonna be perfect". Instead, we should encourage each other to be better/perfect next time, forgetting any past shortcomings. I'm not perfect in everything so I don't stop trying to be perfect next time.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong><span style="display: inline;">Philippians 4:13</span></strong> I can do all things in Christ who strengthens me.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Spiritual growth</strong></h2>
<p>I used to go to a very small traditional church where I did not see multitudes of young people eager to serve in every possible way and I did not grow in faith for many many years. This is how I imagine the "descipleship" in a catholic cathedral/church. I felt like I was doing the same things over and over and nothing used to progress somewhere. I had to hold a tight grip on my faith to not lose it. The preacher used to repeat the same phrases, people did not burn with eagerness for God's power and quite rarely, I got to come out of my comfort zone. Usually, I followed my own lazy feelings, comfortably receiving the word of the sermon, feeling "very clever" and "holy" because I occasionally got to understand something. This is a sickness that Christianity should get rid of, the bacteria causing this are traditions.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong><span style="display: inline;">Isaiah 43:19</span></strong> See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?
I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.</em></p>

<p>God always does new things. So please, people, have some dynamics in your faith. We are <strong>not</strong> most clever "when we feel" but "when we decide" to ask unanswered hard questions. Most holy when we serve God in discomfort. Victorious when we smile in hardships. Strongest when overcoming weaknesses.</p>

<p><strong>Don't be comfortable and lazy! Don't stop praying but keep your faith! If something is hard, it doesn't always mean that you should avoid it or stop.</strong> Whether you are lazy or tired, you can tell by listening to your own words: Do you say: "I want this to be over" Or "I could still do this or that before I finish"?</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong><span style="display: inline;">Matthew 8:20</span></strong> Jesus told him, "Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."</em></p>

<p><strong>Church should be called a practice field where we should learn how to practise being the light of the world and showing selfless love.</strong> So as we congregate, learn to come not in the hope to be served but to serve and expect nothing back.<strong> Be free of this world.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>We are the light of the world, not black holes!</strong></h2>
<p>We grow most when we serve selflessly, <b>not</b> when others serve us spiritually. Do not pray only like this: "God come and fill me!" because you have already been filled with the Holy Spirit. God knows about your need to be filled with the Holy Spirit in order for Him to be glorified. But He first needs us to be his available hands and legs.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong><span style="display: inline;">Matthew 6:32-33</span></strong> For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. 33 But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</em></p>

<p>As Christians, we need to change our perspective, the way we think. Aim outwards, surrender your desires to God which He knows you have. It forces us to come out of our comfort zone and to rely on only on God and so it is so much more powerful way of praying! Then you'll get experience and you will actually be a soldier of Christ who does work for God.</p>



<h3>Selfishness and selflessness</h3>
<p><b>Crazy example:</b> If you're in a gym and praying like this: "Jesus help me pull myself up this bar one more time! And one more time!" How about this prayer instead: "Jesus help me become a blessing to anyone I will meet in the gym so I can be a light for you." The second prayer is outwardly focused, the first one aims inwards. So they are aiming at the opposite directions which is the difference between being selfish and selfless.</p>

<h3>Is being selfish always bad?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> You can "love yourself" but put others first.</p>
<p>Another story (Matt 14): After John the baptist was beheaded, Jesus, because he was fully human, He must have experienced grief and we read that he wanted to go to a private place. As he went across a lake (or a sea), multitudes of people had awaited him already there. And moved with compassion He healed their sick. So in my opinion, it is nothing bad to experience a desire to be served, pray for yourself or "chill out" but if you can help, ideally other people should take priority. <strong>Whoever can show the greatest love is the greatest in heaven</strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong><span style="display: inline;">Mark 9:35</span></strong> Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all</em></p>


<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>

<p>So Christian love is a proactive act of choosing joy no matter what, it makes one stand up and fight for the good, as opposed to follow some dead rules (pray 72x these words daily) or commands (which don't make sense), we just look at Jesus and do what we know is right, as best as we can.</p>
