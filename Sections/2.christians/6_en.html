-The mission of a Christian should be identifying the works of the devil in order to overcome all barriers,
that means proclaiming gospel (good news, heaven on earth) over that situation!
</p>

-Coming out of comfort zone is a healthy way of living: As you get more and more familiar with any
surrounding environment, you may become overtime like the prophet who is not respected in their own region
because you will be sensing this hostile spiritual world around you and one way of ridding yourself of
negativity is to just move elsewhere and start over. This is a good solution but doesn't show full strength.
Sometimes it is good to move and discover and learn new things. But if you have enough wisdom to stay, just
start overcoming yourself in every area (Christian's mission). You will start doing unusual things, be surrounded
with unusual things. Life is not going to crush you, but you will crush the world just as Jesus overcame the world.
Every attack of the devil will become victorious and the devil will only regret every attack since you will just
gain strength instead of loosing and becoming weaker.

-This is how I get wisdom through faith and prayer: Today I was sitting on a chair, my mind pretty messy, 
so I felt like I couldn't really pick anything specific as to how to organize what to do right now (2h before I go 
to work to use that time well) I stood up, raised my hands and prayed: "God tell me what to do.". I got a very good response: 
I just started doing "good humble chores" in order to serve myself, as opposed to staying lazy. Because I understand that 
it is always the devil who wants us to be lazy, I felt very motivated and energized to do what pleases God most. Such the 
relationship with God is supposed to be. God wants us to be healthy and wisdom comes when we do what is good and healthy. 
With such prayer I've reached for God's light, and thus I become the light of the world.

-In contrast to that relationships, we are not obliged to spread the gospel like JW do, condemning all other Christians.
So when you come across a JW, only keep in mind the freedom in Christ at all times. God is our friend and works with us
not like a commander because He understands best what we want and need and what we don't fully understand we can't fully do.
Therefore no service is supposed to be forced, as Bible says God loves a cheerful giver.

1. Start with a prayer & preaching from Bible & praise
2. I need to overflow, not just be good enough but over the top, enthusiastic or I will struggle. Just like body needs to overflow with energy, have more then
enough to survive the next few hours, we need to have a lot of optimism and energy in reserve.
3. God looks after my internal world and gives me a great peace in which I feel led to the right people. This won't happen if I don't stir this blessing up every day (in the morning).
I felt very sad, lonely and I needed some friendly words and a hug (although I didn't think like I need to get a hug). I praised God, afterwards I just spontaneously did what was right. I went to hug El-Ruth and only then I realized that that was actually surprizingly refreshing. And I just felt like I should talk to the student girls that I didn't know. And they were so nice and friendly that I went hope totally happy.
