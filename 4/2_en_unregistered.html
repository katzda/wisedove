did Mohamed forgive sins and prove it? Only God can do that...
Jesus was teaching us not to swear by our head...hear white
yet Jesus said: I have the authority to forgive sins on earth because from my authority I say: rise, take your mattrace and go home! I think Jesus would've been able to make his hair white.. it actually even happened on the mountine...Whereas even then all desciples after Jesus was resurrected performed miracles not in their own name but in the name of Jesus.

This implies that Jesus is God or in other words I'd say "of God's being" as he was begotten by God - He didn't have a physical father but was conceived directly by the Holy spirit who came to Maria and "the power of the Most High overshadowed" her and so she became pregnant.

No one knows the Father except the Son .... Only Jesus knew the Father .. exclusively!

Jesus taught us "people" to do one thing but this doesn't mean that swearing is all inherently sinful. In fact, swearing is a means of making sure that something will happen however, truly it is better if we leave swearing to God or Jesus as only He can truly fullfill all promises.

Is Islam a peaceful religion? Not at all.
