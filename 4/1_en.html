<h1>Religion vs Jesus</h1>
<p>Satan will never tell you the truth which religion is true. The truth is none. <strong>H<span style="color: #1d2129;">ow do we know that we're worshipping the true God?</span></strong></p>
<hr />
<h2>Religion vs Jesus</h2>
<p>All religions are from the devil, as it implies that the focus is on "ourselves and what to do" rather than "God himself and what He's done". <strong>Religion is about human efforts to become holy and reach God. In fact, it was God who made the effort to bring people back into his presence!</strong> God's effort is called Jesus Christ. Human effort is called [your name]. It is wiser to trust in the priest God has established, rather than making a priest out of yourself or any thing or anyone else. Know that coming to God is possible <strong>only</strong> through God's the only Son, Jesus Christ, as I'll explain later.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="background-color: #fff;"><strong><em>Leviticus 5:6</em></strong> As a penalty for the sin they have committed, they must bring to the LORD a female lamb or goat from the flock as a sin offering; and the priest shall make atonement for them for their sin.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="background-color: #fff;"><strong><em>Romans 6:23</em></strong> For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="background-color: #fff;"><em><strong>Romans 8:1</strong></em> there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p>This implies that the concept of reincarnation is not true, since we are justified through the blood of God's Son and do not need to "live again" if such thing was ever a question in Bible.</p>
<h2>We are created in God's image</h2>
<p>Use the common sense: <strong>God is the creator. God is Love and he created us in His image.</strong> Now people too have a desire to create robots in our image. <strong>So we need to be like God - showing love.</strong> Jesus gave the ultimate example what it means to be connected to God when He died on the cross for our unholiness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Would it ever make sense for God to say: "You shall put all non-believers to jail, torture them and murder if they do not become muslims."? No! <strong>The true creator of the universe is a caring God</strong>! Who would ever create a masterpiece and then never even care what happens to it? God does care and <strong>never wants anyone to perish</strong>! What kind of God would it be to create a world with the purpose of making people destroy themselves? God does love you and never intended people to suffer. God intention is to surround you with great Love, Peace, forgiveness, give you his Holy Spirit and an eternal life!</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="background-color: #fff;"><strong>John 3:16</strong> "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."</span></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>God loves you so much He would rather suffer himself instead of you! He gave His only Son to suffer the death on a cross because of our imperfections. And so I too choose to suffer rather then inflict my pain upon other people. <strong>God wants all people to be filled with unconditional love for one another, just like He loves YOU unconditionally, we are supposed to follow this example and be like Him</strong>!</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="text-align: justify; background-color: #fdfeff;"><strong>Romans 5:8</strong> But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners.</span></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Religion is about the focus on physical things or people, how clean or dirty they are. But with Jesus, this is no longer a valid point. No longer it matters where we are (be it Vrindavan, Mecca, Jerusalem or on the street with a filthy homeless men) because it is no longer the physical means by which we are cleansed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Religion thus may (if terribly misunderstood) lead to anti-love in the form of fights against those others "unclean" people. <strong>Bible sais that no-one is perfect so nobody can boast and that Jesus is the priest doing the cleansing job spiritually in heaven whenever anyone needs.</strong> This allows us to focus on the actual love in faith in freedom of our fleshly bounds. Jesus overcame the world and so we too must deny ourselves, every day take up our own cross and follow Jesus (and overcome our bodies).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For who is effectively the holy person (like God)? The one who murders the homeless man for their filthiness or the one who is showing compassion? Jesus allows us to actually be like the light of the world; no longer we are affected by darkness, but rather the darkness (the homeless man) should be affected by us. In Jesus, salvation (=going to heaven) is through the acts of love because of faith in Jesus.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you show mercy, you will be shown mercy by God. If you forgive without becoming angry for the filth you see in other people, God will too consider you worthy of being forgiven regardless of your own filth. That is the unconditional love. Jesus died for us while we were still sinners. So we too must love everyone while they are still non-believers. If you do not forgive, even God will not forgive you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #001320; text-align: justify; background-color: #fdfeff;"><strong>Luke 6:38</strong> For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you by God.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p>Therefore who is the greatest in heaven, the closest to God? <strong>The one who shows the greatest love!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="background-color: #fff;"><em><strong>Matt 20:27</strong> Jesus said: "Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all, just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</em></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>God knows you in and out and have done all for you to be able to come into his glory again! He knows what you need. You need love. You need care. You do <strong>NOT</strong> need to feel shame for being a woman! You should shine with happiness and be like a beautiful flower! You do <strong>NOT</strong> need to cover yourself as if God was ashamed of creating you! You are God's masterpiece the way you are right now! You are far more precious than any amount of diamonds! Jesus gives you freedom from all cultures and wants to give you life in abundance! In Jesus, people realize self-worth. When you serve God, do it NOT because of other people! Do it only if you decide you want to serve, not because you feel pressure. That should not be the motivation. Faith in Jesus and love be the motivation!</p>
<h2><strong>Beware of the bad examples</strong></h2>
<p>Jesus didn't say that the most important thing to do is to sing praises to God to reach forgiveness. Krishna's followers do not even think in terms of forgiveness but maybe the way how to think, focus, meditate, what to avoid eating.. their own human ability to cleanse themselves, and if ever they become perfect, Krishna will accept them, otherwise they have to reincarnate again. They may have some good techniques but it does not show faith in <strong>how God Himself reached out for sinners that we know it's happened historically 2000 years ago</strong>:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We proclaim that: <strong>"Jesus Christ died and rose from the dead and now He is interceding for us in Heaven."</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>God has confirmed this truth in Jesus by literally and apparently raising him from the dead!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus didn't teach people to visit "Jerusalem" once in their lifetime in order to be saved. Or allow only for Christians to enter the holy city otherwise they should beat the non-christian, possibly to death. Nope! <a title="Quoting the web as it appeared 3.3.2018:'If you somehow get into Mecca as a non-Muslim, and you are found out, the civilians might get to you before the government does. In this case, you could suffer beatings, or even murder.'" href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Mecca">[1] https://wikitravel.org/en/Mecca</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus was aware of the controversy between religion vs relationship when He sais to Martha who was focused on the acts of serving more then on Jesus himself:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="background-color: #fff;"><em><a title="Click to read the full story" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A38-42&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank"><strong>Luke 10:41</strong></a> "Martha, Martha," the Lord replied, "you are worried and upset about many things. But only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, and it will not be taken away from her."</em></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Satan deceives the world so all think that in order to please God you need to do this or that. Go to Mecca, Pray rosary 20 times in a row, sing Hare Krishna 20 times in a row, wear special ceremonial robes (catholics, muslims), attend old style church-buildings which arouse goosebumps, avoid eating particular foods, etc. <strong>There is NO POWER in these THINGS in terms of cleansing of your soul. There is only ONE WHO cleanses our souls.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I read in Matthew 23: No one is to be called Rabbi, Father or instructor amonst Christians, for there is One Teacher, One Father and One Messiah in heaven. It strikes me how religious the catholic church is and how they disobey this command. We are all to be called brothers/sisters. There is no one on earth to be called or regarded as something more than a sibling in Jesus. In practice, we are no different from the homeless, from the crippled and the disabled. We just happened to be lucky to find the source of all good. <strong>Do not put your trust in any ritual, any thing or human like the Pope, virgin Mary, Ghandi, Prabhupada, Muhammad or any other religious guru or yourself.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The only source of forgiveness is Jesus whom God the Father established as the living perfect priest forever.</strong> No thing or human can be placed in between God and You other than Jesus Christ. The role of Jesus is to cleanse those who put their trust in him. Everybody who is even a little religious knows they generally need to be cleansed somehow. Jesus is the only one capable of this as the following text explains:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="background-color: #fff;"><em><strong><span style="color: #520; text-align: center;">Hebrews 7:</span></strong></em> Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office; but <em>because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. Such a high priest truly meets our need - one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens. Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself.</em></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The point is, we need Jesus in order to prosper in every way, in a healthy loving way when we follow the sound teaching of Jesus.</p>
<h2 id="newlifeinjesus"><strong>New life in Jesus</strong></h2>
<p>If you would like to receive Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, pray the following prayer:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Jesus // come into my heart // and be my Lord. // Forgive my sins. // Wash me and change me. //</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jesus // I believe you died for me. // Thank you that you rose from the dead // and now pray for me from heaven. // Help me to live for you. // And fullfill everything You have called me to do. I thank you that I'm now forgiven // And on my way to Heaven // In Jesus name // AMEN.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have the best news anyone will ever tell you: God loves you and he has an amazing plan for your life! If you really ment this prayer, the Bible says that all your sins are forgiven and you can know for sure that you're on your way to heaven. Remember when you make a mistake don't run from God, run to Him, because he loves you and he does have an amazing plan for your life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>God's intention is to restore what's been corrupted in You at the very source. There are still some remnants of the sin in our hearts that we need to keep overcoming. One day God will make everything anew and there will be no sin, sickness or crying but for now we need to participate in this battle with God, the ally, who is winning the battle for us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This faith in Jesus is not passive or negative that would say: "You can now do wrong things and still be saved."</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="color: #001320; text-align: justify; background-color: #fff;"><strong>Romans 2:4</strong> God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance</span></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This faith is proactive and life-changing: <em>"Because I am not perfect, I don't run away form God but I run to God the way I am right now and ask and declare positive things and blessings in faith over situations, knowing that I <strong>AM</strong> cleansed and 100% accepted by God because Bible tells us so through Jesus and His appostles."</em></p>

<h2>That's all</h2>
<p>"Oficially" I'd fnish here because I love to make things succinct. But I thought I have this more to say if anyone's interested:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>1 Corinthians 9:20</strong></em> To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law. To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God's law but am under Christ's law), so as to win those not having the law. To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Christians are supposed to be independent of clothing, culture and the style we worship God. Also because Christ died for everybody, all rases and nations are equally important. <strong>Pray that you see yourself the way God sees you, have the eyes that see the way that God sees other people and that your heart is stirred by the things God's heart is stirred.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I just pray that Christians would stop creating new and new "religions" (~denominations) and instead start focusing on Jesus and practically learn to actually do good and start evangelizing more about <strong>Christian love</strong> - not like Jehova Witnesses do when they just advertise how Biblical and perfect their denomination is, forgetting to mention the most substantial <strong>freedom in Christ.</strong></p>
