-The mission of a Christian should be identifying the works of the devil in order to overcome all barriers,
that means proclaiming gospel (good news, heaven on earth) over that situation!


-Coming out of comfort zone is a healthy way of living: As you get more and more familiar with any
surrounding environment, you may become overtime like the prophet who is not respected in their own region
because you will be sensing this hostile spiritual world around you and one way of ridding yourself of
negativity is to just move elsewhere and start over. This is a good solution but doesn't show full strength.
Sometimes it is good to move and discover and learn new things. But if you have enough wisdom to stay, just
start overcoming yourself in every area (Christian's mission). You will start doing unusual things, be surrounded
with unusual things. Life is not going to crush you, but you will crush the world just as Jesus overcame the world.
Every attack of the devil will become victorious and the devil will only regret every attack since you will just
gain strength instead of loosing and becoming weaker.

-This is how I get wisdom through faith and prayer: Today I was sitting on a chair, my mind pretty messy, 
so I felt like I couldn't really pick anything specific as to how to organize what to do right now (2h before I go 
to work to use that time well) I stood up, raised my hands and prayed: "God tell me what to do.". I got a very good response: 
I just started doing "good humble chores" in order to serve myself, as opposed to staying lazy. Because I understand that 
it is always the devil who wants us to be lazy, I felt very motivated and energized to do what pleases God most. Such the 
relationship with God is supposed to be. You pray what to do, God will answer and you obey regardless of your laziness. 
With such prayer you have reached for God's light, and thus you will become the light of the world.

-In contrast to that relationships, we are not obliged to spread the gospel like JW do, condemning all other Christians.
So when you come across a JW, tell him or her: You know God desires relationship before he wants sacrificial serving? 
Let's pray right now: God thank you for these people, I pray that you would give me some more wisdom for now to decide
right now what I should do. We are free people in Jesus, so that all Christians do different things according 
to the way they are gifted. Thank you Jesus for giving me freedom of choice how to give glory to God 
because you understand best what I want and what is best for me to do right now. And nobody will rid me 
of this freedom in Christ, as we do not follow dry general commands but direct words of living God.

-After 3 years of being with Jesus, the disciples didn't begin describing him as an ordinary human like any other. He was a 
superhuman. They didn't say: Ou don't worry about that, Jesus is a bit moody again. Instead they kept saying things like: "Today Jesus 
went to us walking on water." Another day Jesus stood, rebuked the storm and it became very quiet and then he turned to us and rebuked 
our little faith. And we can't really say a word because we fully deserved it and we could never really say a word because
Jesus is always the Teacher, not someone who actually makes mistakes.

-When disciples went through the field on Sabbath, Jesus explained that Sabbath is not about keeping the dead law but
about the relationship with God. Then it doesn't matter what you do because you are being made righteous through this
relationship. David did not have Jesus as a friend to tell him "you can go to the priests and eat their bread" and yet
He was able to act by faith.
