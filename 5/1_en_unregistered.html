<h1>The Gospel from unusual perspective</h1>
<hr />
<p>
It's about believing that there is a sense in belief in Jesus. This invisible fact that forgiveness through Jesus works, is to be observed through faith and not questioned. Only then you discover its perfection and the way how to live fully and not just how to "survive in this purposeless life with no enlightenment or motivation for change, doomed to perish in your ignorance like animals who just follow the flesh". Do you think that faith in Jesus is only for some people? Some may incline to it more easily but that doesn't mean that it's easy. But whoever has been born again and discovered its meaning, no longer needs to face a state of hopelessness. Faith is for everyone with no exception but usually only some will find it and stick to it. It's about perseverance to have faith and God answers such prayers. Maybe not with exact words but we just find that things are getting resolved and that we have Jesus' words to lean on, like a guide through life in all situations.

Because God can have everything, it would be just boring and pointless to just create exactly what He wants. And so He created a world of limited people.
God has to wait and suffer because only through suffereing, when you don't have what you want straight away but follow the right principles, one can actully enjoy life and stay motivated - like people who suffer but at the end they say they would not exchange the experience for anything.
</p><p>
In the same way God cannot have everything at once and be happy. The world is an image of God's own heart and we are created in His image. He suffers and is a ruler, we suffer and are ment to rule and not be defeated by our own sadness. Then in heaven we will be able to have a fellowship with Him personally without feeling ashamed. Only through suffering we live life like kings overcoming difficulties, unstoppable by the world's circumstances. People have been created to become rulers [1*] and children of the most high God - and not to become homeless, pointless and miserable!
</p><p>
God doesn't want anybody to perish and be condemned but gives time for everyone to find the way to life - to Him. [2*] Of coarse God suffers a lot. Most importantly, we all are like the prodigal son [3*] and Father is brokenhearted to see us following lies and perishing in hell. Secondly God has to suffer our imperfections and daily forgives us and loves us unconditionally no matter how bad we are. But as long as we are willing to seek perfection and persevere in faith, this is not like an issue, it just shows that we as well should suffer other people and forgive them and love them unconditionally.

<h6>Why imperfect?</h6>
<p>
One explanation, which I allow for now, could be that God wanted to see others ejoying what He himself cannot have - to sin and to take shortcuts. God could be imperfect and take shortcuts but because of His nature as I described above, He won't, He would deny his own principles & purposse. So from God's perspective, being able to be imperfect may be a pleasant thing since it allows for cheating or just doing whatever we want as kids. Of course as Christians we should learn to leave imperfections and focus on what is perfect and all is fine with God as long as we try to follow what is perfect - in our very best imperfect way. So the cheating should only be like a side effect of us being born without knowledge.
</p><p>
However, Bible sais that there is not a single dark spot in God. Also because God deeply searches every heart for all impurities, it would be unreasonable to think that He himself has this secretely split desires. Which means that there must be suffering in order to give his creation a permanant value. Nothing, that you can get plenty of everywhere for free without any painstaking work, you carefully look after but you may as well throw it away carelessly.
</p><p>
The unfortunate thing of imperfection is that not everything will go according to the ideal scenario. Some people will not acknowledge God as the saviour from their imperfection and so God has to remain 100% faithful to His own holiness and righteousness and punish what is imperfect, there is no other way, because again He would just deny himself and his purposse & principles. Suffering must exist. But He doesn't want to punish us and so He would rather punish Himself once for all rather then having all of us perish. 
</p><p>
Thing is, whenever we do what is imperfect (=follow our addictions), we are commiting a very slow suicide (even choices like watching telly instead of visiting a gym or eating sweets instead of veg). Ever since a human became imperfect God said that we would die and turn into dust again and that man will have to work sweat (having a job) in order to live. I can see that having a job is one more healthy thing on my list that I do because it teaches me to be not lazy in all aspects. And guess what - it's sort of like suffering because it's not always easy, but that's life. God works, we work. [4*]
</p><p>
But there is hope: Accept Jesus Christ who suffered death on a cross for the sins of the world and you will live life in light and direction otherwise God will ultimately have to punish You personally for every single little shortcoming, which is death, separation from God and pain. 
</p><p>
All have been born as imperfect which implies that all need to discover God for themselfs at one point. Only Jesus Christ was always perfect and thus he always knew who was his Father [5*]. With the option of being forgiven, you will be able to expect that one day we shall be transformed into perfect beings and finally live with God forever.

	<li>* <strong>Prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32):</strong> He also said: “A man had two sons. The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the estate I have coming to me.’ So he distributed the assets[a] to them. Not many days later, the younger son gathered together all he had and traveled to a distant country, where he squandered his estate in foolish living. After he had spent everything, a severe famine struck that country, and he had nothing.[b] Then he went to work for one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. He longed to eat his fill from[c] the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one would give him anything. When he came to his senses,[d] he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired workers have more than enough food, and here I am dying of hunger! I’ll get up, go to my father, and say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I’m no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired workers.”’ So he got up and went to his father. But while the son was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him. The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I’m no longer worthy to be called your son.’

	 “But the father told his servants, ‘Quick! Bring out the best robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Then bring the fattened calf and slaughter it, and let’s celebrate with a feast, because this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!’ So they began to celebrate.

	 “Now his older son was in the field; as he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. So he summoned one of the servants, questioning what these things meant. ‘Your brother is here,’ he told him, ‘and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’[f]

	“Then he became angry and didn’t want to go in. So his father came out and pleaded with him. But he replied to his father, ‘Look, I have been slaving many years for you, and I have never disobeyed your orders, yet you never gave me a goat so that I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your assets[g] with prostitutes, you slaughtered the fattened calf for him.’

	“‘Son,’[h] he said to him, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”
