<h1>Faith is a choice!</h1>
<p>It's all about the choice to have faith and pursue it. Are you facing any difficulties at the moment? Do you have any health problems or would you like to see any positive change in any area in your life? Just pray to God about it - that's faith.</p>

<p>We declare that God is the creator of this world, so He can do anything. It doesn't have to be humanly possible for us to believe in it. On the other hand, because God is the creator of this world, His answers don't necesarily look like a miracle but like something quite natural. That's one reason why people are usually so blind to accept God who takes care of us - just like Bible says (only saying because it makes sense):</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>John 1:10</strong> He was in the world, and the world was created through him, and yet the world did not recognize him.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe we are taken care of when we learn to rely on faith, esp when we do something extra good or extra faithful (where one would otherwise help himself in the immoral or ungodly way).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not only things will start changing when you pray, one first needs to pray to Jesus for forgiveness so as to become a child of God through the Holy Spirit. You will experience a living God in your life - so not any more you will ever be alone. If you would like to receive Jesus into your life, <span class="link" data-refname="ReligionMuslim" data-innerHTML="click here"></span>.</p>

<p>Faith is like a shield. You ignore what you can see with your eyes and you just proactively start praying and doing what is right. Everyone needs a shield, othewise you may find yourself too weak to believe in a positive change. You may not even know about the things you need to change. Because of this weakness, you may take an extreme unnecessary step. But the right way of thinking is this:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Romans 8:28</strong> We know that all things work together for the good of those who love God, who are called according to his purpose.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those were symptoms of unbelief so everybody should be daily strengthening their "faith muscle", the positive way of thinking. The devil wants you to think that faith is a weakness because it's a crutch. Not really, faith is a shield! People have not been created lame but there's always an enemy in the world and so everyone needs means of defense. This allows you to stand firmly and fight where others would just give up and let all evils kill them slowly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Ephesians 6:16</strong> In every situation take up the <strong>shield</strong> of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.</em></p>
