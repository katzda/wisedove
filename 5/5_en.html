<h1>Help us knowing YOU</h1>
God is a living God. bible: "i havent revealed my name to them so far"
Its all about how much we know God, do not put first the how you think you understand about God. Understanding of God and growth comes through faith.
Its about perseverance of faith which brings fruits. 
Testimony about a girl who cried when she shared her story how she "couldn't feel her knees" which ment that the pain was gone. Jesus said that we are to be perfect just as the father is perfect. Spending time with God will give you joy and peace, most importantly you will know God personally and you will let God work on you. Trust God fully and learn about God through Bible and He WILL restore you.

God's heart towards you hasn't changed just because your circumstances have.

God always keeps his promises. Bible is a revelation about God's promises.

Because Jesus is our friend, not a heartless commander.
We are to worship God wholeheartedly for the sake of the relationship with God.
God did not establish sabath for the sake of the day but for the relationship.
So as long as we seek God with greater intensity on the 7th day, it's all fine.
However even if someone can't do it, not that the law has been abolished but we should
understand that the point is to be close to God. Are you close to God? That's the whole point.
Jesus literally was breraking the Sabbath saying: "My father always works and so I work too".
