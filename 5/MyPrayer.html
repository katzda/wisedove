<h1>My prayer</h1>
<p>It is not some abstract Karma that is causing us to fail and that is defiling our bodies.</p>
<hr />
<p>
It is our physical broken bodies which need healing, it is our physical misunderstanding of the truth which needs enlightenment and it is our real world tangible bad deeds which need to be forgiven. It is the physical existing things which need correction right now, which needs to be dealt with and it is not some abstract Karma that's present in the cooking pan or in somewhere else that if we happen to be around it, it would cause us to be impure and unworthy of God's love.

It's not true because it doesn't even have to be our fault. Clensing your karma doesn't make you clean. Jesus makes your completely clean right now. Yes we may still want bad things (as if we still had bad karma) but that's a normal thing because we are not perfect. How to purify your karma in Christian terms means to pray that God would soften your heart again and again, daily, so you no longer cling to the pleasures of the world but to God. And you don't have to worry about karma in onions, garlics and anything we eat. It is just our heart that desires which is the root of all sin - and we can very practically change that. For example, every time we feel anything imperfect against them (like a hatred, negativity) or against God (laziness, lack of faith, hardheartedness,..), we can pray for people, wish them all goodness by speaking it out and change it by naming the problem correctly and declaring a blessing and love to rule in that situation, most importantly asking God for help - instead of helping yourself by chanting hare hare hare hare hare hare hare hare. Probably chanting may soften your heart, but we teach that salvation is through JK.

	<span class="questions">I can't answer: What will happen with the people who devote all life to chanting and be spiritual but do not believe in Jesus as the only way? Why would JK be the only way? In a way, JK is the only way for God to forgive sins. Do we necessarily have to believe certain facts in order for God to say, yes I will forgive you? If we do all what's in our power, in the truthfulness of our mind to do what is right, won't God justify that person even if they did not believe that Jesus is the only way but the redemption was still paid. On the other hand, do we need to ask Jesus personally and receive the holy spirit to be saved? Did the jews all have the holy spirit?

So I just pray that God you would make me focused on other people, that I would no longer be focused myself how to get attention from people but that I would begin to understand it's not about myself. It's about you that I'd just be focused on you Lord Jesus. How do I become helpful to other people, not about me but everything but me which means on you and other people so somebody may think "okay It's about God so I can be alone with God". No because apart from us there's also other people and we need to be focusing on other people. So it's literally the opposite of being focused on ourselves which means everywhere else.
</p>
<p>
It's not just God which is everywhere but it's all other people and other situations everything around us is more important. But only after we save our own soul. If we do not have our own soul forgiven that we can't possibly serve other people. You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to be able to take out the speck out of your brother's eye.
</p>
<p>
You can't serve and help others if you aren't happy yourself. If you're focused on other people before being focused on yourself then you're not even doing it for God because other people will take priority before God and that's not healthy and that's not Godly. Serve for the sake of God and your goodness that you must receive in Jesus. 
</p>
<p>
So what I just pray that I would be a blessing for everybody around me that I would just keep helping people around me and I believe that I don't need to focus on us in a selfish way on myself to get attention from others because if I'm focusing on others you will cause other people to be focused on me in Jesus name

That's how our needs will be met because God can restore our hearts,because God is solving all our problems practically and Jesus happened to be the necessary physical means how the sin of the world is dealt with how the impurity of our hearts can be forgiven through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. It's not so that we can be just justified. "Oh, I will just justify you" there has to be punishment for every wrongdoing, there has to be a punishment.
</p>
<p>
But in Jesus Christ as the rules over punishment because Jesus took our sins and in everything we can trust that when we repent when we trust when we believe in Jesus.
</p>
<p>
God takes the punishment on him and we no longer need to experience God's punishment because God is merciful and he's willing to take that offering so that we can be shown mercy so that we can instead of dying we can live and Jesus says whoever believes in me will have life and and have it abundantly. We will be made whole.
</p>
<p>
Through the love of God, God's working in us to become a whole person who lacks nothing because He will be able to meet the need His way, the correct way, the way that requires work and patience. Jesus said enter the narrow gate, for 
</p>
<p>
When we rely on God and put all our needs on God everything will be dealt with. Amen.
